# Next Plan: Improving the To-Do List Application

## Current Features
- Add, complete, and delete tasks
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Clean UI with CSS styling
- Modular code with separate storage.js

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Task Management
- **Priority Levels**: Add high/medium/low priority with color coding
- **Due Dates**: Allow setting deadlines with date picker
- **Categories/Tags**: Group tasks by categories (work, personal, etc.)
- **Task Editing**: Allow editing task text after creation

### 2. User Experience Improvements
- **Search and Filter**: Add search bar and filters by status, priority, category
- **Drag and Drop**: Reorder tasks by dragging
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add shortcuts for common actions (e.g., Ctrl+Enter to add)
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple tasks for bulk delete or mark complete

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions for adding/removing tasks
- **Responsive Design**: Better mobile/tablet support
- **Progress Indicator**: Show completion percentage

### 4. Data Management
- **Export/Import**: Export tasks to JSON/CSV, import from file
- **Backup**: Automatic local backups
- **Data Validation**: Prevent duplicate tasks, validate inputs

### 5. Advanced Features
- **Reminders**: Browser notifications for due tasks
- **Statistics**: Show productivity stats (tasks completed per day/week)
- **Themes**: Multiple color schemes
- **Offline Support**: Service worker for offline functionality

### 6. Development Improvements
- **Unit Tests**: Add Jest or similar for testing functions
- **Build Process**: Add webpack/parcel for bundling
- **Documentation**: More detailed README with screenshots
- **GitHub Pages**: Deploy live demo

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Priority levels, due dates, task editing
2. **Medium Priority**: Search/filter, dark mode, export/import
3. **Low Priority**: Drag and drop, statistics, notifications

## Next Steps
- Choose 2-3 features from high priority
- Create branches for each feature
- Implement incrementally with testing
- Update documentation

Would you like me to start implementing any of these features?
